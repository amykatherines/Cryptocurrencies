# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

To better determine potential customers' credit risk, we employee several Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms to determine if there is a model that does a decent job of predicting credit risk.  We first utilize three methods of sampling algorithms and use logistic regression to make predictions to evaluate the models.  Second, we utilize an over and undersampling method called SMOTEENN. Finally, we use two Ensamble Classifiers.  For all these methods, we calculate the balanced accuracy score, create the confusion matrix, and generate a classification report so we can evaluate each and compare effectiveness in determining credit risk across all models.

## Results



Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
