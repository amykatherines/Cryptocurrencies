# Crypto Currency Unsupervised Machine Learning

Several unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to evaluate crypto currencies in the crypto_clustering.ipynb file.  This analysis is to help our Accountability Accounting determine what crypto currencies to offer in a portfolio of crypto investments.  The following methods are used to analize the data:

1. Preprocess the Data for types required for ML processing
2.  Apply Principal Component Analysis
3.  Reduce Data Dimensions Using PCA
4.  Cluster Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
5.  Visualize Cryptocurrency Results
